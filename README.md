# 30 Days of Java Fundamentals

This repository contains my notes and exercises from the "30 Days of Java Fundamentals" series by TrainingMug, taught by Madhu Samala.

## Day-by-Day Summary

### Day 1: Git Installation and Version Control
- **Git Installation**: Steps to install Git.
- **Version Control**: Introduction to version control, its importance, and basic Git commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, `git log`).

### Day 2: Primitive Data Types and Type Casting
- **Primitive Data Types**: Overview of Java's primitive data types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
- **Type Casting**: Converting between different data types, including implicit (automatic) and explicit (manual) casting.

### Day 3: Conditional Statements and Loops
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`.
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.
- **Exercises**: 
control flow statements like `break` and `continue`.

## Table of Contents
- [While Loop](#while-loop)
- [Do-While Loop](#do-while-loop)
- [For Loop](#for-loop)
- [Break Statement](#break-statement)
- [Continue Statement](#continue-statement)

### Day 4: Coding Questions on Loops
- **Practice Problems**: Solving various coding problems focusing on loops (e.g., pattern printing, sum of numbers, factorial, Fibonacci series).

### Day 5: Fundamentals of OOP
- **Creating Classes and Instances**: Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), creating classes, and instantiating objects.
- **Accessing Instance Variables**: How to access and modify instance variables.
- **Memory Management in Java**: Understanding how objects are stored in memory, the role of the heap and stack, and garbage collection.

### Day 6: Methods
- **Defining Methods**: Syntax and structure of methods in Java.
- **Method Parameters and Return Types**: Using parameters and return types in methods.
- **Method Overloading**: Concept of method overloading (same method name with different parameters).
- **Static vs Instance Methods**: Differences between static methods and instance methods, and when to use each.




## Tips for Continuing Your Learning
1. **Practice Regularly**: Consistently solve coding problems to strengthen your understanding.
2. **Read Documentation**: Refer to the official Java documentation for detailed explanations and additional examples.
3. **Build Small Projects**: Apply what you've learned by building small projects or contributing to open-source projects.
4. **Join Communities**: Participate in Java programming forums or groups to seek help and collaborate with others.
